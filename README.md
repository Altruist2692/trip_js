# TripJs

For websites, it's quite common that you need to have a tutorial trip to teach new comers how to user your own services. In addition to this, when there is any new feature coming up, you also need that to make sure your hard works do have been seen and used by users. Same like you, we have been making tons of routine works like that and that's why we are going to make a super lightweight library - Trip.js that you can use for most cases ! Hope you will like it :)

## Browser Support

Trip.js has been tested and it works well on IE 9+, Chrome 32+, Firefox 32+ and Safari 9+

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'trip_js'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install trip_js

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
